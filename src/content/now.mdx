- **Working at Openhouse**

  I started my first full-time job as a Product Engineer at [Openhouse](https://www.openhouse.study) after a fruitful internship experience with them previously. (Check out the website, I was part of the team that built it!)

- **Reading 15 pages a day**

  I enjoy reading, but I cannot get around to it that often. Hence, I decided to
  read exactly 15 pages a day, no more no less. Following this system, helps me read
  about 1.5 (average 300 paged book) books a month, and hence ~18 books year, which
  isn't a bad number in my opinion.
