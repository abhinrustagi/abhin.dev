- **Reading 15 pages a day**<br />
  I enjoy reading, but I cannot get around to it that often. Hence, I decided to read exactly 15 pages a day, no more no less. Following this system, helps me read about 1.5 (average 300 paged book) books a month, and hence ~18 books year, which isn't a bad number in my opinion.<br />
